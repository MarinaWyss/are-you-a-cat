# ZenML Month of MLOps Competition

![Test status](https://github.com/MarinaWyss/zenml-mlops-competition/workflows/run-tests/badge.svg)

This repo contains code for the [ZenML Month of MLOps Competition](https://blog.zenml.io/mlops-competition/).

I intend to build an image classifier to predict if you are a cat or not, based on a selfie uploaded to a Streamlit app.

Dev plan:

- [X] Find data
- [ ] Data prep
- [ ] Baseline model training locally (logistic regression)
- [ ] Hyperparam tuning locally
- [ ] Model registry
- [ ] Performance evaluation and deployment
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Streamlit app
- [ ] Presentation

Stretch goals:

- [ ] SHAP, to illustrate what properties of the image contributed to the prediction
- [ ] Model iteration, likely a CNN trained on the cloud
- [ ] Monitoring
