# Are You A Cat?
### An MLOps Project for the [ZenML Month of MLOps Competition](https://blog.zenml.io/mlops-competition/)

![Test status](https://github.com/MarinaWyss/zenml-mlops-competition/workflows/run-tests/badge.svg)

This repo contains code for a pipeline to predict if you are a cat, based on a selfie uploaded to a streamlit app.

Or at least it will, once I've got it up and running. :-)
