### Problem Statement
Sometimes it is hard to know if you are a cat or not. The goal of this project is to use deep learning to help with that.

J/K. It's really about me practicing some MLOps and deep learning stuff. There's a lot more I want to do to improve this pipeline, so my plans for future iterations are included in the project description below.

### The Solution

![pipeline](https://github.com/MarinaWyss/are-you-a-cat/blob/main/_assets/pipeline.png?raw=true)

This project uses [ZenML](https://zenml.io/home) to build a simple end-to-end pipeline for a model to identify if a photo (selfie) uploaded to a Streamlit app is of a cat or not.

#### Training Pipeline

The training pipeline is pretty simple: Clean the data, train the model, and evaluate model performance on the test set.

##### Data

Training data for this project comes from the following datasets:
- [Cats and dogs](https://github.com/rpeden/cat-or-not/releases)
- [Selfies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jigrubhatt/selfieimagedetectiondataset)
- [Random images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shamsaddin97/image-captioning-dataset-random-images?resource=download)

I'm using a random sample from each of the above. For training, I used 25% cat images, 25% dogs, 25% selfies, and 25% misc.

Data prep is simple: The images are reshaped and normalized. That's it for now!

##### Data Validation

Data validation for the training and testing data is done with [Deep Checks](https://deepchecks.com/). There is not currently a ZenML integration for non-tabular data, so this step is not integrated into the pipeline, but can be run ad-hoc via `run_data_validation.py`. The validation report is saved to the `data/` directory. 

##### Model

The model for this project is a 2D CNN, implemented with Tensorflow Keras. The model, hyperparameters, and training metrics are saved using MLflow autologging as experiment tracking artifacts.

The model's hyperparameters were tuned using `keras_tuner`. The best model configuration achieves recall of 0.8 and precision of 0.53 on a hold-out test set. Note that there are several limitations to the current model training, which are noted below, so the performance can certainly be improved on.

##### Evaluation

The trained model predicts on a hold-out validation set, and logs those metrics to MLflow as well.

#### Deployment Pipeline

The deployment pipeline extends the training pipeline and implements a continuous deployment workflow. It preps the input data, trains a model, and (re)deploys the prediction server that serves the model if it meets some evaluation criteria (minimum recall and precision).

##### Deployment Trigger

After the model is trained and evaluated, the deployment trigger step checks whether the newly-trained model meets the criteria set for deployment.

##### Model Deployer

This step deploys the model as a service using MLflow (if deployment criteria is met). 

The MLflow deployment server runs locally as a daemon process that will continue to run in the background after the example execution is complete. When a new pipeline is run which produces a model that passes the evaluation checks, the pipeline automatically updates the currently-running MLflow deployment server to serve the new model instead of the old one.

#### Inference Pipeline

This project primarily uses a Streamlit application for inference, but it contains a separate inference pipeline for testing as well.

#### Streamlit Application

For inference, I have a simple [Streamlit application](https://marinawyss-are-you-a-cat-appstreamlit-app-ccycwd.streamlit.app/) that consumes the latest model service asynchronously from the pipeline logic. 

The Streamlit app takes in a photo (selfie), and returns the probability that you are a cat. It saves the photo and user feedback about the quality of the prediction to S3 for future training and drift detection.

As a next step, I'd like to add a SHAP explanation of why the prediction was made for this particular photo. 

Note that there are currently dependency resolution issues using the latest version of ZenML with \
Streamlit (see [this open PR](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/888)), so the app is temporarily using the model from the training pipeline.

### Limitations

This pipeline is a simple first pass, and has some major limitations. Some things I plan to incorporate in the future include:

- Data:
  - I didn't check the accuracy of the labels. I have so far assumed that all the images in the "cats" dataset I downloaded are \
    actually cats, for example.
  - I also didn't confirm that there are no duplicates in the train data and test data (I just split naively and assumed).
  - Data validation is not yet incorporated into the training or deployment pipelines, but rather is run ad-hoc separately.
- Model/Training:
  - Currently, I'm training locally on a small dataset. In the future, training should be done in the cloud (i.e. Sagemaker) with more data/maybe for longer. I have this mostly set up, but just haven't completed it yet.
  - Hyperparameter tuning is ad-hoc and manual. ZenML is planning hyperparameter tuning support in the future, so I'll add that once it's available.
  - I haven't done any in-depth model performance work yet (e.g. no error analysis or real experimentation). I haven't even tuned the classification cut-off.
  - Model training is slow. This may be because I'm using an old laptop at the moment, but there may be ways to improve the efficiency of model training.
  - There is no model validation step.
- Deployment:
  - Deployment is currently happening locally via MLflow. In the future I will migrate this to Seldon or KServe for deployment in a more production-friendly setting.
- Monitoring:
  - I have very little set up besides basic logs.
  - So far I have set up the Streamlit app to save user photos and feedback, which could be used in the future to evaluate model performance on real-world data, catch drift, etc.
    - However, I have no input data validation set up, people could give inaccurate feedback, and I haven't done any rigorous testing on the app UI.
    - I'm also not sure if there are privacy concerns with my current approach...
  - I have no way to know about user errors in the app, or performance metrics (e.g. latency).
- Orchestration:
  - Running the pipeline is currently ad-hoc and manual. In the future I would like to re-train with some of the new, user-generated images on a regular basis with Airflow.
    - It would be even cooler if I could do some kind of continual learning approach so that I don't need to store the images at all...
- Misc:
  - Dockerizing might make sense.
  - There are likely opportunities for better testing, since currently the tests I have are quite minimal.
